            secrets of GOT. Believe me you will thank me later. Here are some Easter eggs that you might have missed. </p>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The infamous Iron Throne is made up of hundreds of swords but did you know that one of them once belonged on the set of Lord of the Rings? 
                Yes, that’s right! A sword on the throne is actually the sword used by Lord of the Rings’ Gandalf. Did your sharp eye spot Glamdring? It seems the two fantasy worlds might just be intertwined, after all!</p>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Put two and two together and you’ll notice that the Game of Thrones map is just Britain above an inverted map of Ireland! This comes as no surprise,
                 considering there are several plot-lines that are actually inspired by historical events in these countries!</p>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Were you itching for Game of Thrones to confirm that R+L=J theory from long ago? Well, it was pretty much confirmed all the way back in season one with this clue! Look closely at this scene with Jon Snow and 
                you’ll notice a sneaky hidden message in the background. The carvings on the tree next to him write “RL”. Now, if this Easter egg doesn’t impress you, we don’t know what will!</p>

                    <h5><u>Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen Parallel</u> :</h5>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The R+L=J theory was pretty much confirmed to us in the season six finale but we were given hints earlier on in the season, too.
                   When Jon emerged from beneath the pile of people in the Battle of the Bastards, it reflected the amazing moment Daenerys rose above 
                   all her followers back in season three. This mirror image could have implied that Jon Snow and Daenerys were related – hence the R+L=J theory.
                   This powerful visual may also confirm that Jon and Dany together are the song of ice and fire. Find out more Jon Snow theories in our elaborate post!

                  <p>  
                      There’s no opening sequence that gives you chills more than the GoT one. Have you ever sat down and analysed it, though? Do you watch it with eagle eyes every week? 
                      You should!Every opening sequence features a sneaky secret – the locations where the episode will be taking place! Apparently every episode’s map must contain King’s Landing, Winterfell, 
                      The Wall and ‘wherever Daenerys is at the moment’, even if she doesn’t appear in that episode. Mind-blown, right? How did we not notice this these past eight years?!
                  </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>  
                        George RR Martin is definitely a Lord of the Rings fan! Frodo Baggins’ best friends in Lord of the Rings are named Sam and Pyp. Is it a coincidence that Jon Snow’s friends were also named 
                        Sam and Pyp?! If you spotted this connection, kudos to you!

                      <p>  
                          The GoT cast have a great sense of humor in real life! This Easter egg was a major spoiler; we can’t believe nobody saw Oberyn’s death coming! This photo of Lena Headey pushing in Pedro 
                          Pascal’s eyes was taken before that epic episode in season 4 aired. Even the cast enjoy foreshadowing their characters’ gruesome deaths!

                            Thought you recognized Osha somewhere before? She played Nymphadora Tonks in the Harry Potter movies! The TV show paid tribute to her witch character in season one when she was seen making brooms.
                             Brooms also featured in several shots with Osha, too!
